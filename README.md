========

LAPACK++ is a library for high performance linear algebra computations.
This version includes support for solving linear systems using LU, Cholesky,
QR matrix factorizations, for real and complex matrices.
     
This package is a simple wrapper for downloading the Lapack++ library
and exporting it to the ROS system so it can be referenced.
